376,"Series creator Kazunori Yamauchi mentioned that ""Gran Turismo Sport would be coming to the PlayStation 4 console, possibly ""in a year or two [from 2013]"". He also mentioned that it will be based on the same physics engine that Gran Turismo 6 uses. Yamauchi also spoke of the release sometime in 2016 or 2017 and how much more powerful the game will be on PlayStation 4 and how much easier it is to develop on the console versus Gran Turismo 6 on the PlayStation 3. Gran Turismo Sport was officially announced at the 2015 Paris Games Week. Sony originally claimed that Sport is a separate entry, but Yamauchi later confirmed that it is a main entry in the series.",1.0

Recording continued at GodCity until October 1999, occurring ""completely sporadically; a week night here and there, maybe a full day during one weekend of a month or two"". Brodsky describes this as ""quite evident from the sound of the record"". During these sessions, some new material was composed, including ""Memorial Drive"", ""Glass of Shattered Youth"", ""Cadence for a Rainy Day"" and ""Cadence for the Desert Sun"". The last Kid Kilowatt song ever recorded was the album version of ""Tug of War"". The record was mastered at M-works in Cambridge, Massachusetts.",0.3333333333333333

The object of the voyage was to seek medical aid for the members of the crew who were suffering from dysentery and fever, and seek repairs to the sloop. Flinders' intention was ""to stop a day or two"" at the Archipelago of the Recherche for ""the purposes of procuring geese for our sick people, seal oil for our lamps, and a few casks of salt from the lake on Middle Island."" Investigator arrived on the evening of 17 May 1803 and anchored on the north side of Middle Island, between the island's north east point and Goose Island, in the area known as Goose Island Bay. The visit to Middle Island also allowed the burial of the sloop's boatswain, Charles Douglas, who had died on 18 May 1803, to take place on dry land.",1.0

In November 1582 the Spanish ambassador informed Lord Burghley that ""a ship or two"", owned by Mr. Ughtred of Southampton, had robbed off Newfoundland more than 20 ships belonging to the King of Spain, and that the Admiralty court had awarded one of these, ""laden with fish and grease"", to Ughtred, his ships having brought her into Bristol. Over a year later Francisco Hernandez of Viana, was still attempting to get compensation for this or another attack on Portuguese ships off Newfoundland.",1.0

It was mixed in MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach. The collaboration between Perry and Dr. Luke was set up by record executives at Capitol Records, who felt that One of the Boys was lacking an ""undeniable smash or two"", and the two co-wrote ""I Kissed a Girl"" and ""Hot n Cold"" as a result.

381,"The event received mixed and negative reviews. Belzer recalled the show being ""wonderfully sleazy"". The Courier-Post summarised the event as ""rather entertaining"" but was ""mostly obscured by the bad taste, cruelty and borderline pornography"" that made up the bulk of the program. The Town Talk wrote Stern had ""single-handedly set back cable pay-per-view a millennium or two"" and described the special as ""bone-achingly dull and stupefyingly simple-minded."" The best known review was by Kay Gardella in the New York Daily News, which was based on other people's opinions and not from watching it herself. Stern attacked Gardella on the air, which resulted in Gardella reviewing the special after watching the cassette.",1.0
382,"Michael Stewart, Wilson's Foreign Secretary, recommended that Britain take preliminary steps towards removing Beadle from the Privy Council if the Chief Justice did not resign or dissociate himself from the republic ""within a week or two"" after the new constitution came into force. Given the gravity of such an action&mdash;only one Privy Counsellor, Edgar Speyer, was struck off the list during the 20th century&mdash;and the likelihood that accusations of vindictiveness would result, the British government was loath to do this, and hoped that Beadle would remove the need for it by resigning.",1.0
383,"The median is often the site of brush fires ignited by passing vehicles, and the tree has survived many of them. A fire in August 2011 was close enough to melt the tree's plastic irrigation system, but the tree was not seriously harmed even though the fire burned the surrounding vegetation and scorched some of the tree's lower branches. Some reports say the fire burned out on its own, while others say the tree was helped by ADOT employees, as well as citizens and ""a firefighter or two"".",1.0
384,"Billy Dukes of Taste of Country gave the song four stars out of five, calling it ""the boundary-pushing song country music needs to embrace every year or two"" and writing that Rose ""showcases a big, commanding voice that will be overlooked in this PG-13 rated single."" Matt Bjorke of Roughstock gave the song four stars out of five, saying that it has ""a groovy melody, a spitfire kind of verse structure and a sassy vocal delivery that a song like this requires.""",1.0
385,"The EP was announced after the conclusion of Ng's End Credits tour and release of his cover single ""Hey Ya"". As with his previous songs, the entirety of the EP was written and produced by himself. During production, he created three different versions of ""Drugs"" and two versions of ""Rock + Roll"". By contrast, ""And"" was written in ""a day or two"" and became one of the fastest songs he produced. The songs drew on a combination of past experiences.",0.6666666666666666
386,"The story of the races goes back to 1959 when the American periodical ""Yachting"" sponsored a 'One of a Kind' regatta. The most successful catamaran in this event was ""Tigercat"" designed by Bob Harris of New York, which was considered by many to be the best in the world. In Great Britain, John Fisk, together with Rod Macalpine-Downie, had won the R.Y.A. 'One of a Kind' series with their Thai Mk IV. Downey and Fisk considered their boat superior to the upstart Americans, and thought that, as far as catamaran design was concerned, ""the old world could still show the new world a thing or two"". A friendly challenge was issued, and the format's similarity to the America's Cup resulted in the competition's unofficial nickname: the 'Little America's Cup'.",0.6666666666666666

389,"Describing the large size of the collection, Entertainment Weekly's David Browne compared it to the two installments of Use Your Illusion (volumes I and II) by Guns N' Roses and claimed that it ""is impossible to digest in one sitting"". Browne ultimately awarded the collection a grade of A− and called it a good representation of the singer's ability to ""chang[e the] definition of pop"" and ""make mainstream adult pop that was strong, elegant, [and] even passionate"". Joe Brown from The Washington Post was more mixed towards the effort: ""All four discs are dotted with oddities that even the most devoted Barbraphiles will program their CD players to skip after the first listen or two""; however, Brown appreciated some of the rarities on the album, including her duets with Garland and her melody of ""My Man"" and ""Auld Lang Syne"".",1.0
390,"Connah had obtained two radiocarbon dates on samples gathered during the 1961 excavation, which he had published in 1969; these results were included in the Gathering Time analysis, and one was resampled and tested again. Five other samples drawn from Connah's finds were also radiocarbon dated, as Connah's stratigraphic recording was precise enough to make it possible to identify samples which had good association with the building of the enclosure. The conclusion was that there was a 91% chance that Knap Hill was constructed between 3530 and 3375 BC, and a 92% chance that the ditch had silted up at some time between 3525 and 3220 BC. The researchers concluded that it was likely that the site was in use for ""a short duration, probably ... well under a century, and perhaps only a generation or two"".",1.0
391,"Matsuyama had trouble portraying L and worried about his performance. He reasoned that L rarely interacted with others, and so portrayed him as if he did not ""quite understand other people on an emotional level"" and had trouble emulating L's postures. He also ate sweets like those that L would eat, and considered the details of L's signature gestures. Matsuyama said that he and Tatsuya Fujiwara, the actor portraying Light, became ""so immersed"" in their character portrayals that they did not speak to one another while on the set; when filming ceased they conversed and ""went out for a drink or two"". Hideo Nakata, the director of L: Change the World, told The Daily Yomiuri that he wanted to exhibit L's ""human side"" that was not exhibited in the Death Note series.",1.0
